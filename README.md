![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mahemood123/CSS-ON-Ritual-of-Reveal?style=flat-square)

A small CSS utility for creating a "Ritual of Reveal" effect (reveal animations / masked transitions).

## Quick links
- Releases: https://github.com/mahemood123/CSS-ON-Ritual-of-Reveal/releases
- Changelog: CHANGELOG.md

## Setup

1. Add the CSS file to your project (copy or link from the repo):
   - File: path/to/ritual-of-reveal.css (adjust path to actual file in this repo)

2. Include the stylesheet in your HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/ritual-of-reveal.css">
```

3. Example usage:
```html
<div class="ritual-container">
  <div class="ritual-mask"></div>
  <img src="assets/demo-image.jpg" alt="Demo">
</div>
```
(Replace classes with the exact classnames from the CSS file as needed.)

## Demo
- Add animated GIFs or MP4 in `assets/` and reference them here:
```markdown
![Demo GIF](assets/demo.gif)
```
- For multiple steps, show 1–3 short GIFs or a single concise video (300–800ms loops work well for quick demos).

## Screenshots / GIFs
- Put demo images in `/assets` (e.g., `assets/demo.gif`, `assets/screenshot-1.png`) and include them above the examples.
- If you want to host a live demo, include a link to GitHub Pages or CodePen.

## Release badge
Add this markdown badge to the top of README to show the latest release version:
```markdown
![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mahemood123/CSS-ON-Ritual-of-Reveal?style=flat-square)
```
Note: The badge shows the latest published release tag. Create a release (e.g. v0.1.0) to populate it.

## Publishing a release
- Create a release/tag for the repo (e.g. v0.1.0) and add release notes summarizing features and fixes (copy from CHANGELOG.md).
- Attach demo assets (GIFs, example HTML) to the release if you want them downloadable.

## Contributing
- Please open issues or PRs for enhancements, bugfixes, and demo contributions.
- Follow the changelog format when proposing new release notes.
